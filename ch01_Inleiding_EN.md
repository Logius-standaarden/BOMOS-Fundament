# Introduction 
We will start with a series of acknowledgements, before presenting the BOMOS ‘Commandments’, which bring together many of the elements that make up BOMOS. We will then describe the structure behind BOMOS before introducing the Management and Development Model itself in detail, concluding with an overview of the subjects discussed in [BOMOS Part 2: The Substantiation](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping). 

## Acknowledgements 
Work on the predecessors to BOMOS was started in 2006, but it was not until 2009 that the first BOMOS publication saw the light of day, with its characteristic activity diagram. In other words, whichever way you look at it, BOMOS has been around for more than ten years. 

Since then, numerous working groups have become involved, all contributing to BOMOS. A positive development, that effectively reinforces the essence of BOMOS: For and By practitioners in standardisation. BOMOS as a source of inspiration for the practice of standardisation, and use of BOMOS had undoubtedly led to new experiences and needs that in turn can be integrated in the BOMOS system. It has also led to a number of different versions and variations of BOMOS, which have not made using the system easier. 

![xkcd comic about competing standards](images/xkcd_standards.png "Strip over standaarden”) the idea behind this now famous cartoon is that the problem of too many standards can be solved by introducing a new standard to replace all the other standards. At the end of the day, the result is nothing more than the addition of a further standard. We have the same intention with BOMOS, but uphold the hope that the result will be different: a single BOMOS as the starting point for everyone. 

At the end of 2018, Logius organised a session to discuss the use of BOMOS; an inspiration session attended by some 40 people, representing around 30 different organisations, all of which use BOMOS (to a greater or lesser extent). One wish that emerged from this session was to produce this new version...but who should take on that task? We raised our hand, and set to work not with the objective of making too many changes to BOMOS, but rather to create this one integrated new version that replaces all previous versions while at the same time taking into account the latest developments; after all, the world of standardisation has not stood still. 

Only time will show whether we have successfully replaced the earlier work with this version, or whether we simply fell into the same old trap.

## The 13 BOMOS ‘commandments’ 
1. ‘An unmanaged standard is not a standard!’
2. ‘It is never too early to start looking into possibilities for managing the standard.’
3. ‘Developing and managing a standard is not a temporary project which makes project financing an unsuitable source of funding.’
4. ‘Developing and managing a standard is a situational process which potentially means a different structure for every standard!’
5. ‘A standard is never finished!’
6. ‘How open a standard can be depends entirely on the structure of the development and management process.’
7. ‘A sustainable standard is a standard that is open and managed.’
8. ‘The worst thing about standards is that there are so many of them; it is crucial that they be reused (inspired by Professor Tanenbaum: “The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from”.’)
9. ‘The management of standards has a great deal in common with other artifacts_ (framework agreements, data, apis, ...) which makes BOMOS also suitable for use in other contexts.’
10. ‘A standard is not good or bad, open or closed, etc.; there are many shades of grey, and always room for improvement.’
11. ‘Without standards there would have been no pyramids (standards are as old as humanity itself).’
12. ‘Standards, employed in architecture, form the basis for interoperability.’
13. The essence of a standardisation process is cooperation; that makes standardisation a cultural phenomenon.’  

## Background 
The management and development of standards is no easy task. Nevertheless, standards are often developed without ever considering the further development and management of those standards. This is because standardisation is often implemented in the form of a temporary project. Based on project funding for the development of a standard or a related facility, without considering structural deployment. This coincides poorly with the continuous development and management of standards.  

## Purpose
 The purpose of this publication is to assist organisations in compiling and improving the management of standards. This publication provides answers among others to the following questions: 
* How can we successfully (further) develop and manage the standard in our organisation?
* How can be structure development and management in such a way that it results in an open standard?
* How can we improve the adoption rate of our standard among users?
 Thes specific questions were the original reason for drawing up the Management and Development Model for Open Standards (BOMOS) with its best practice guidelines for an open structure for management. Since that time, BOMOS has been used in practice, and users have expressed the need to share more knowledge and experience with the management of standards.  Other issues such as improving interoperability based on standards, transparency and the manageability of standards have been added. Finally BOMOS is now used as the common language in the world of standardisation. 

## Target group
The purpose of BOMOS is to support and inspire standardisation communities and their clients in the structural design and management as well as the further development of standards. Practical insights are used to provide this target group with simple and clear models and recommendations. 

## Approach & History
The Working Group CMO (Community Model Open Standards), a working group within the Open Standards Office (which was later renamed the Standardisation Forum) at GBO.Overheid (which later became Logius) started working on this subject in 2006. The outcome of their work, a memorandum, was made available by the Standardisation Forum and served as the starting point for the development of BOMOS version 1. 

The approach selected to develop BOMOS was a structured discussion with a small group of experts from the semantic standardisation organisations, during which knowledge was shared on the relevant issues. This resulted in version 1 of BOMOS in 2009. 

Following this initial publication, a new series of meetings were held in 2010, that were also attended by users of the first version. Based on their experiences and new insights, BOMOS was first expanded and extended to become: BOMOS version 2. 

This approach helped anchor the knowledge available within organisations involved in the development and management of standards, including Logius, Geonovum, Kennisnet, CROW, Informatiehuis Water, Stichting Elektronische Transacties Uitzendbranche (SETU), The Netherlands Normalisation Institute (NEN), VNG Realisatie (the implementing body of the Association of Netherlands Municipalities), research organisation TNO, the University of Twente and many others. 

Under the auspices of the Standardisation Forum, work was started in 2012 on an expansion entitled BOMOS2i, in which the ‘i’ stands for implementation. A practical guide for use of BOMOS in the standardisation process. Another variant of BOMOS was published by TNO under the name BOMOD. This too discusses management and development processes but in relation to the publication of datasets rather than standards. During this same period, BOMOS was (re)published in different house styles. All in all, this process did not result in greater clarity among users. 

In around 2017, Logius once again started to work on BOMOS. An expansion to BOMOS2i was published with the addition of a standards framework, which was used to build the BOMOS measurement tool. This tool enabled managers to actually assess management of the standard.

 In 2022, this version of BOMOS (version 3.0.0) was published to provide BOMOS users with a new fully integrated starting point for working with BOMOS.
 <aside class=" example" title="BOMOS gebruikt door CROW">
To safeguard any further development, and with a view to the interests of all users, CROW used BOMOS to manage the IMBOR. Using BOMOS as a management tool delivered the following benefits for IMBOR:

- The interests of stakeholders are evenly balanced in the development and management of the standard.
- The standard is updated together with the users; everyone can contribute ideas.
- Management is transparent.
- Information is accessible to everyone, with clear conditions of use.

## BOMOS structure

BOMOS consists of:
* [BOMOS Part 1: The Foundation (this document)
* BOMOS Part 2: The Substantiation](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping)
* BOMOS Supplementary modules: [Linked Data](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-LinkedData) en [Stelsels](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Stelsels)

The heart of BOMOS is the ‘Foundation’. This consists of a basic description of the Management and Development Model and a further elaboration based on literature and experiences gained in practice.  In essence, the Management and Development Model is an activity diagram which also offers a definition of the roles relevant in the process of managing and developing standards. 

In addition the [BOMOS in part 2](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping) offers further insight in particular by sharing best practices from the world of standardisation. 

Together Part 1 and Part 2 form the basis for BOMOS.
 On top of this basic structure, the community has produced a number of BOMOS expansions which can be useful in deploying BOMOS in concrete situations, some of which may involve a slightly different context. We refer to these as the BOMOS Supplementary Modules or a Body of Knowledge, which will remain dynamic over time. 

When we talk about BOMOS, what we are actually referring to is the basis as described in Part 1 and [Part 2](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping). Although the supplementary modules are clearly linked to BOMOS, they have their own governance, which can result in their being given their own name, their own target group, their own management system, etc. The [BOMOS management process](#het-beheer-en-ontwikkelmodel-onderwerpen-voor-ontwikkeling-en-beheer) also describes the requirements that are imposed before something can be added as a BOMOS supplementary module. 

 The first two supplementary modules are:
-	[Linked Data & Ontologieën](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-LinkedData): the specific use of Linked Data for sematic standards.
-	Structure for [BOMOS for the management of trust framework](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Stelsels): the use of BOMOS in the specific situation governing trust frameworks.

## Reading guide 
If from your policy making or administrative role you are only interested in the primary level, the foundation (part 1) will offer sufficient background and context. If however you are personally active in standardisation communities, you can seamlessly continue with reading part 2: The substantiation with best practices, which includes more background and practical tips for standardisation. 

If you actually intend to make use of BOMOS, it is advisable that you also study the supplementary modules. These contain examples and tools that could prove useful for implementing open standards. The supplementary modules also contain variants on BOMOS. These implementation profiles make BOMOS suitable for use with more than just semantic standards.
