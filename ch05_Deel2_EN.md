# BOMOS best practices a review - Introduction to BOMOS Part 2: The Substantiation

On its own, the Management and Development Model for standards creates a foundation, but it is not enough to solve all the standardisation issues. Choices have to be made in a number of different areas, relating to the structuring of the management process for standards. This reveals a number of different issues such as:

For example about:

* Adoption: how can you encourage it?
* Open: I hear about ‘openness’, but what does it actually mean?
* Business case: What is the ultimate benefit?
* Financing: What does it actually cost? And what are good sources of income?  
* The quality of the standard leads to problems and dissatisfaction.
* Suppliers that want to be certified so they can boost their profile.

These subjects are discussed in detail in Part 2 - The Substantiation:

**[The organisational structure](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#de-ontwikkel-en-beheerorganisatie-activiteit-governance)**

The activities from the Management and Development Model are carried out in an organisation structure, which often consists of an implementing organisation that receives orders from the governing body. The implementing organisation works with working groups to fulfil the orders. As well as working groups, separate groups of suppliers and/or advisory bodies can be established. The management and development activities can be entrusted to an internal organisation, but for specific tasks, other organisations such as formal standardisation organisations, knowledge institutions or sectoral organisations can be called in. There are different possible legal forms for the internal management organisation, the most common of which is the foundation.

**[Financially: costst and benefits](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#de-kosten-en-de-opbrengsten-activiteit-financien)**

Few figures are available about the revenue and costs of standardisation. Nevertheless, we do know that standards deliver added economic value. The advantages include network effects, preventing vendor lock-ins and lower transaction costs.

Apart from all these major benefits, it is sometimes difficult to prepare a balanced budget for the standard. A standard involves development costs, while it can be difficult to realise revenue from the standard, in particular revenue that is not contrary to openness. A growth model has been prepared for the revenue side. Temporary financing suitable for the start-up phase is not a suitable source of funding for continuous management. Without structural financing, the most obvious form appears to be working with membership fees or paid services. These options restrict the consequences for openness.

The business case for standards is an important subject. Here, based on experience gathered with a standard for the jewellery sector, we outline a three-stage approach to drawing up a simple business case. The outcome is not hard figures, but it does provide a picture of how the costs and benefits are distributed among the various stakeholders.

**[The open implementation of a standard](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#de-open-invulling-van-een-standaard-activiteit-community)**

We all want open standards, but except for a definition we have few pointers as to what an open standard actually means. Based on 10 criteria, including the obvious Open Intellectual Property Rights, there are also less obvious criteria such as Open Change (who decides when a new version should be issued?) and One World (1 standard for 1 worldwide problem). The 10 criteria have been made measurable, to enable a standard to determine its own openness, and to initiate improvement processes.

 **[Coherence with other standards](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#samenhang-met-andere-standaarden-activiteit-architectuur)**

Due to their relationships with other standards, semantic standards are extremely complex. To achieve interoperability, the first essential requirement is a combination of technical, syntactical and semantic standards. Semantic standards can be recognised in what is known as horizontal and vertical (domain) standards. There is also a distinction between international standards and the ways they are implemented nationally. Standards of this kind are also referred to as agreements or application profiles.

In turn, these standards use vocabularies (or code lists). All variants of standards must be managed. In other words, an international standard is not the end point; in many cases it fails to solve interoperability problems. Many semantic standards are developed outside the formal standardisation organisations (such as NEN and ISO) but they do often have a difficult relationship with formal standards, made so by the potential absence of openness in these standards. At national level, we must often deal with national implementations of international standards, a complex relationship which calls for a strategy. Do any alterations we make apply internationally to the standard, or is it simply a question of adapting the international standard? For that aspect too, strategies have been devised. 

In the world of semantic standards, the Semantic Web / Linked Data concepts have been key developments for handling and recording the semantics of the data. These developments are based on a series of often W3C standards.

**[Adoption: stimulating the use of a standard](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#stimuleren-van-het-gebruik-van-standaarden-activiteit-adoptie-erkenning)**

The value of a standard is to an important degree formed by the number of users. After all: the more users, the easier it is to exchange data via the standard, within a given sector or group of organisations. With that in mind, many standardisation organisations are keen to accelerate the adoption of their standard(s). Various different tools are available for this purpose: communication (information, promotion, etc.), financial (implementation grants and subsidies, funding of pilot projects, offering implementation tools, etc.) and legal (enforcement, for example via ‘apply or explain’).  It is important to select the most appropriate tool. This depends on what is known as the likelihood of adoption in the network of organisations (collective business case) and individual organisations (business case for individual organisations).

**[Quality of a standard](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#kwaliteitsbeleid-en-benchmarking)**

Over time, the quality of standards will become an increasingly important issue. We often forget that the objective is not the standards themselves, but interoperability. A poor-quality standard will not lead to interoperability, and it often takes some time before we realise that interoperability has not been or is only partially achieved in practice. Research has shown that the majority of management organisations believe that the quality of the standard could be improved and that this will in turn lead to an improvement in interoperability. That makes it important to improve the quality of standards.

Based on existing models, for example from software engineering, a first version of a quality model is proposed in which quality concepts such as effectiveness, reliability and usability are further elaborated. By employing this quality instrument, it is possible to improve the quality of standards.

 **[The operational proces to develop and manage a standard](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#proces-voor-de-ontwikkeling-en-het-beheer-van-een-standaard-hoofdactiviteit-operationeel)**

Gathering wishes and requirements for the standard is an important step in the operational process and can be achieved in a number of different ways, ranging from workshops to online on the web. These wishes and requirements pass through a process, before they can be included in the standard. Version management is a key issue, since too many versions can threaten the adoption of a standard. The operational process of standardisation is often described as time consuming and inefficient. Methods that make use of Web 2.0 applications or the concept of the pressure cooker can make it faster and cheaper to develop standards.

**[Conformance, certification, validation](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#kwaliteit-van-implementaties_sectie)**

Often when a standard has been in existence for say two years, the need for certification emerges. Suppliers are keen to commercially exploit their implementation of the standard and certification can be a valuable tool. The management organisation itself could offer certification with a variety of objectives (promoting interoperability or adoption or financing) each of which could have different effects and which are not always easily combinable.

Certification is complex and the best advice is to start with validation and drawing up a list of supplies who use the standard. Validation can also be used to check conformance with a standard but enjoys a lower threshold.

**[Offering support to implementations](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#implementatie-ondersteuning)**

Offering support to implementations is the consequence of strategic and in particular tactical choices relating to adoption and quality among others; other best practices subjects.
Hence a shorter description of possible solutions.

**[Spread the word!](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#communicatie-bekendheid-creeren)**

The above statements also apply to communication activities, but these activities must never be underestimated. At the end of the day, the essence lies in ensuring that the standard is used in practice, and this means that the standard must enjoy a high level of awareness in the professional field. Such awareness does not happen by itself.
