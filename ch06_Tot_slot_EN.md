# In conclusion

One important subject which often remains little discussed in terms of knowledge of standards is the structure of the development and management process. BOMOS is an attempt to provide a guideline for structuring a development and management process within an organisation. It places additional focus on how the development and management can be achieved in an open manner.
The document also explains that the development and management of standards is a complex issue, comprising numerous different tasks which may or may not have to be implemented, and which can be implemented in different ways, depending on the context of the standard.
The document also shows that openness has numerous different aspects, more than can be achieved based on the definition of an open standard. Krechmer’s 10 points are sometimes forgotten in practice, leading to a great deal of concealed closedness. Based on these points, an attempt can be made to introduce a very open structure to development and management. In that process, the ten points, combined with practical tips, are above all suitable for initiating the relevant thinking processes.

The aim is and remains a sustainable standard that contributes to interoperability. Sustainability can only be achieved if the structure of the development and management process is of high quality. This document contributes to raising the level of the development and management of standards, thereby creating more sustainable standards. At the end of the day, a sustainable standard is an open standard that is sustainably managed!

To conclude part 1, we offer three concrete tips:

1. Describe the fulfilment of the package of tasks on the basis of the BOMOS activity model. (BOMOS Compliant)
2. Create continuity in the development and management of a standard by:
   1. Ensuring a stable/structural financing model.
   2. Entrusting the core tasks to a structural not-for-profit organisation.
3. View openness as a means of raising quality and simplifying adoption: use the 10 points from  [Krechmer](https://logius-standaarden.github.io/BOMOS-Verdieping/index.html#krechmer-s-open-standaarden-model-10-requirements) for identifying improvements in openness.

Just like a standard, BOMOS itself will never be finished; based on new experiences, new ideas can emerge. And there are plenty of other possible opinions on the subject. At the same time, this document could raise questions when you start to use it. We hope to establish an active BOMOS community that will play a role in this process and will ensure that new BOMOS Supplementary Modules are made available.
