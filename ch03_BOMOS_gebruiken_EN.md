# Using BOMOS

How can BOMOS be used? There are a number of different options:

1. As a tool for further development of management organisations
2. As background information and a source of inspiration
3. As a mirror for the current management process

## BOMOS as a tool for further development of the management organisations

The most important application of BOMOS is as a tool for the further development of management organisations. Many management organisations originate from an initial project or programme. This is sometimes linked to a specific provision. Management of the standard can then have a dependency with the operational management of that provision. To enable the standard to be deployed more broadly, further considerations are needed and BOMOS can be useful in that context.

Another application is the structuring of a completely new management organisation. If organisations opt to agree on a standard in a sector, it is not possible to avoid reaching not only substantive but also financial and management-related agreements. In that case, BOMOS can be a useful guideline for reaching those agreements.

There are a number of options:

1. 	Is there already a standard in place?
 	On occasion there is not yet a standard but a standard needs to be developed. In the chapter on operational management, we consider gathering the correct wishes for and requirements on the standard. The next step is to build the bridge to the management process.

2. 	Structuring the management process
 	It starts with setting the scope for the management process: what does the management process need to be equipped for? To manage a single standard or multiple standards? Depending on the answer, using BOMOS, it is possible to make a choice relating to the management activities (strategic, tactical, operational) and support activities. Using BOMOS it is not only possible to deliberately choose whether or not to undertake certain management activities; the system also contains hints and tips for the structuring of the activities themselves.

3. 	Has a management organisation already been established?
 	There is often already some form of management structure. In that case, BOMOS can be used to check whether all activities still comply and whether in addition to operational activities, strategic and tactical activities also need to be dealt with. BOMOS can also serve to improve the openness of the process.

4. 	Tackling specific problems

 	There are often specific problems. BOMS can also be deployed to create a tailored approach to implement improvements on the basis of best practices and reference models for such issues as: 
 * Quality: how can the quality of a standard be measured and improved?
 * Adoption: how can the adoption of a standard be accelerated? What tools can be employed for that purpose?
 * Financing: how can the financial model of a management organisation be improved, for example if funding is declining, or wishes change?
 * Validation and certification: how is it possible to test whether the implementations of a standard comply with the specifications imposed? What possibilities are available?

In the Netherlands, Geonovum develops and manages the basic geostandards. The geostandards are included in the apply or explain list published by the Standardisation Forum. In 2014 we received the label excellent management, partly because we manage the geostandards in accordance with BOMOS. Geostandards ensure that we are able to exchange geoinformation in digital form and (re)use that information in a variety of software packages for a variety of purposes. There are generic standards which enable basic functionalities such as ‘search’ and ‘present’. There are also standards focused on the ability to meaningfully exchange data, often within a specific sector. The BOMOS system is appropriate for both the generic geostandards with a management plan and a change protocol and for specific domain standards.

TOOI (Thesaurus and Ontology for Government Information) is a model for the information published by all organisations within the Dutch government. Using the TOOI model, it is possible to make information coherent and findable, across the boundaries of individual organisations and information systems.

The TOOI management plan describes how the specifications for TOOI are managed. It encompasses both the management organisation and the underlying rules and regulations. The TOOI management plan was established according to the principles of BOMOS. The structure based on the 5 themes from BOMOS (Strategy, Tactical, Operational, Implementation Support and Communication) are described in detail on the [website](https://standaarden.overheid.nl/tooi/beheerplan).

## BOMOS as background information and a source of inspiration

BOMOS is extremely useful as a source of background information, for example for the parties who commission standards. The BOMOS Model was in fact developed for this purpose, and lays a solid foundation. Knowledge about the management of standards is essential for everyone involved in standardisation.

In the substantiation section, solutions are presented based on practical experience: where possible, examples are used to demonstrate the acceptance of the solution in practice, to describe the standardisation organisations that have experience with that process and to present the related recommendations and advice. In other words, valuable background information about practical situations.

Together, these two elements for the basis of BOMOS, and provide inspiring background information. Another example is the use of BOMOS as a tool for administrators and policymakers to help them identify exactly what openness of standards really means. BOMOS is also used as a ‘language’ that allows clear communication about the management of standards.

## BOMOS as a mirror for the current management process

Various organisations use BOMOS as a sort of underpinning or even as a guideline for the management of their (open) standard. Other organisations use BOMOS as an outline checklist and to account for and substantiate specific choices they make. However, BOMOS has no normative role. That is indeed not possible, because the structuring of the management is highly situationally dependent.

Nevertheless, conformity with BOMOS is possible. **The management organisation operates in accordance with BOMOS if a management document is published in which the structure of all elements from the BOMOS Activity Diagram (the Management and Development Model) are described.**

For specific situations, it is possible to define requirements/assessments for each BOMOS activity, in more detail, but these are not part of the foundations of BOMOS, because they may not be relevant for all BOMOS users.

Moreover, even if the management organisation does operate in accordance with BOMOS, this does not automatically mean that the standard also complies with the criteria for the apply or explain list of standards published by the government. However, it is clearly preferable if the registered standards do operate in accordance with BOMOS, as well as focusing particular attention on the chapters relating to the development and management organisation, openness, the operational process and the financial structure.

In linguistic terms, the word ‘Standard’ often refers to something which is jointly agreed on and laid down. In that context, we may conclude that BOMOS is a standard. A standard for (the development and management of) standards.
